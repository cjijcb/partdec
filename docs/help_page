Download a file in parts simultaneously from a remote or local source.

Usage: partdec [OPTIONS]... <URI|LOCAL PATH>

Options:
  -p, --part <N>
          Split the file into N parts. It defaults to 1, if N is zero or
          less. If -s/--size is used, this option is ignored.

  -s, --size <SIZE>
          Split the file into parts of SIZE. SIZE is in byte size and can
          include the following binary prefixes:
          SI: KB, MB, GB, TB (case-insensitive)
          IEC: KiB, MiB, GiB, TiB, or K, M, G, T (case-insensitive)

  -b, --base <PATH>
          Set the base path for output files and also set their filename.
          For multiple output files, an _N suffix is added, where N is an
          incrementing number starting from 1.

  -d, --dir <PATH>[,...]  
          Set the destination directory for output files. Can be repeated 
          and accepts comma-separated paths to specify multiple directories.
          Base path is appended to each directory. 

  -z, --reset[=INDEX,...]
          Reset files to [new] state. Comma-separated INDEX values can be
          provided to reset specific states. INDEX values are 1, 2, and 3
          for [resume], [completed], and [broken], respectively. 
          (e.g., -z or -z=1,3)
  
  -r, --retry <N>
          Set the number of retry attempts to recover from failures during
          downloads. Default is 5; set to 0 to disable. The delay between
          retries starts at 1s and increases exponentially up to 32s.

  -t, --timeout <TIME>
          Set the HTTP request timeout. TIME is a number followed by a
          suffix: ms, s, m, or h to represent milliseconds, seconds, minutes,
          or hours, respectively (e.g., -t 1h2m3s). The default is 0, meaning
          no timeout.

  -H, --header <HEADER_NAME:VALUE>
          Set or add an HTTP header. Can be repeated to specify multiple
          headers. The Range header is ignored in multipart HTTP(S) downloads.
          HEADER_NAME is case-insensitive.

  -x, --no-connection-reuse
          Disable the HTTP Keep-Alive or connection reuse. This ensures a
          separate connection per file part in multipart HTTP(S) downloads.

  -f, --force
          Override the soft limit (128) on the total number of output files.
          This option also disables output to stdout.

  -q, --quiet
          Disable output to stdout.

  -V, --version
          Display version information.

Output File States:
    File states are based on the initial size of files and may change during
    or after the download. States can also be affected by I/O operation errors
    and the file scope, which determines the maximum size a file can reach.

    [new]       File with zero initial size.  
    [resume]    File with non-zero initial size and within scope.  
    [completed] File that has reached its maximum size.  
    [broken]    File exceeding maximum size or with I/O errors.  
    [unknown]   File with undetermined scope.

    A file with the [unknown] state is always truncated to zero size on every
    run with the same arguments. This state occurs when an HTTP(S) server does
    not support multipart downloading.
