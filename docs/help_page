Usage: partdec [OPTIONS]... <URL|LOCAL PATH>
Seamlessly split files from the web or local storage. 

Options:
  -p, --part <N>
            Split the file into N parts. If N is zero or less, it defaults to
            1. If -s/--size is used, this option is ignored.

  -s, --size <SIZE>
            Split the file into parts of SIZE. SIZE is in byte size and can
            include the following binary prefixes:
            SI: KB, MB, GB, TB (case-insensitive)
            IEC: KiB, MiB, GiB, TiB, or K, M, G, T (case-insensitive)

  -b, --base <PATH>
            Set the base path for output files and also set their filename.
            For multiple output files, an _N suffix is added, where N is an
            incrementing number starting from 1.

  -d, --dir <PATH>
            Set the destination directory for output files. PATH can be 
            multiple comma-separated directories. This option can also be used
            multiple times to specify multiple directories. Each specified
            directory is combined with the base path (dir + base path).

  -t, --timeout <TIME>
            Set the HTTP request timeout. TIME is a number followed by a
            suffix: ms, s, m, or h to represent milliseconds, seconds, minutes,
            or hours, respectively (e.g., -t 1h2m3s).
            The default is 0, meaning no timeout.

  -x, --no-connection-reuse
            Disable the HTTP Keep-Alive or connection reuse. This ensures a
            separate connection per output file in multipart HTTP(S)
            downloads.

  -H, --header <HEADER_NAME:VALUE>
            Set or add an HTTP header. This option can be used multiple times
            to specify multiple headers. The Range header is ignored in
            multipart HTTP(S) downloads. HEADER_NAME is case-insensitive.

  -f, --force
            Override the soft limit (128) on the total number of output files.
            This option also enables quiet mode.

  -q, --quiet
            Enable quiet mode.

  -z, --reset
            Reset files with an initial state of [completed], [resume], or
            [broken] to [new]. Same as -CBR.

  -C, --reset-completed
            Reset files with an initial [completed] state to [new].

  -B, --reset-broken
            Reset files with an initial [broken] state to [new].

  -R, --reset-resume
            Reset files with an initial [resume] state to [new].

  -V, --version
            Display version information.

Output File States:
    File states are based on the initial size of files and may change during
    or after the download. States can also be affected by I/O operation errors
    and the file scope, which determines the maximum size a file can reach.

    [new]       File with zero initial size.  
    [resume]    File with non-zero initial size and within scope.  
    [completed] File that has reached its maximum size.  
    [broken]    File exceeding maximum size or with I/O errors.  
    [unknown]   File with undetermined scope.

    A file with the [unknown] state is always truncated to zero size on every
    run with the same arguments. This state occurs when an HTTP(S) server does
    not support multipart downloading.
